\arguments{
\item{data}{the dataset}

\item{target}{the name of the target}

\item{formula.best}{the formula of the base model provided by the user or found in \code{\link{lassoSelection}}}

\item{offset}{the vector values of the offset}

\item{gbm.control}{a list containing the parameters passed to the Gradient Boosting model \itemize{
\item{n.sample}{Number of points used to compute H-statistic}
\item{train.fraction}{Fraction of the data used to compute OOB error}
\item{shrinkage}{Shrinkage or learning rate of \code{gbm}}
\item{bag.fraction}{Subsampling rate}
\item{family}{distribution of the model, to see supported distribution please see \code{gbm} function}
\item{n.trees}{Number of trees of \code{gbm}}
\item{n.sample}{Number of observations drawn to compute the H-statistic, higher value slows down the computations}
\item{n.sample}{Correponds to \code{interaction.depth} parameter in \code{gbm}}
\item{interaction.depth}{The number of splits of each tree}
\item{importance.threshold}{The importance threshold at which the variables are selected to be tested as interactions}
\item{max.select}{Maximum number of variables selected to be tested as interactions -related to previous item}
}}

\item{glm.control}{a list containing the parameters for the computation of the base model and augmented model using \code{glm}\itemize{
\item train.fraction The fraction of the sample on which to train the GLM models
\item family The family of the data passed as \code{glm} function
\item include whether the user wants to include the univariate component of the interaction, default is False
\item speed whether the user wants to include \code{\link[speedglm]{speedglm}}
\item threshold.values The threshold values for the H-statistics
}}
}
\value{
A list of three object. The first object is a list corresponds to the performances of the regression objects of all
 the GLMs. The second is the dataframe with the interacted variables names and the corresponding H-statistic. The last object
 corresponds to the \code{function.call}.
